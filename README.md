## Introduction

The main pupose of this assignment is to get points of interest from open data sources like open street maps (OSM).
Here, we have to create clusters of distinct commercial centers or markets using points of interest data of a city (the city could be yours). Points of interest (POI) data provides location information of different places along with their defining tags like school, type of outlets, type of building, hospitals,railway station ,historical building,etc.

We have to get points of interest data for one city so i have chosen my city (kolkata) , i framed the query in [a link](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) to get the city POI data .
